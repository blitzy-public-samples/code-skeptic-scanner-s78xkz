   - Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Set secure HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-XSS-Protection).
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

3. Dependency Management:
   - Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions.
   - Use tools like Dependabot for automated dependency updates.
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the application and its dependencies.

4. Secure Development Practices:
   - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines for web application security.
   - Implement code review processes with a focus on security.
   - Use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues.

5. Incident Response:
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan.
   - Conduct regular security drills to test the incident response process.
   - Use Google Cloud Security Command Center for threat detection and security analytics.

6. Compliance:
   - Ensure GDPR compliance for handling personal data.
   - Implement data subject access request (DSAR) handling procedures.
   - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

7. API Security:
   - Use Google Cloud API Gateway for managing and securing API endpoints.
   - Implement API key rotation policies.
   - Use OAuth 2.0 for API authentication and JWT for authorization.

8. Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Set up real-time monitoring for security events using Google Cloud Monitoring.
   - Configure alerts for suspicious activities or potential security breaches.
   - Implement automated responses to common security events.

By implementing these security considerations, the Code Skeptic Scanner will maintain a strong security posture, protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity and availability of the system. Regular security assessments and updates to these protocols will be necessary to address evolving threats and maintain compliance with relevant regulations.
